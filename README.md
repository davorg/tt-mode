# tt-mode

A major mode for editing [Template Toolkit](http://tt2.org/) files in emacs.

This was an afternoon of Emacs Lisp hacking in about 2002. I'm
no expert in Emacs Lisp so there are, no doubt, many improvements that
can be made. If you have any suggestions please let me know. Or,
better, clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/davorg/tt-mode/),
make your fixes and send me a pull request.
